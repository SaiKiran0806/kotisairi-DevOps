Theory done.
Practical pending because of repo file.

Maven:
Maven is a build tool. Code of maven is written in Java.
It is an open source & provides uniform build system.
It is more flexible, makes build process easy

Build Tool:
THese are essential for JAVA applications.
They decide whether the application is JAVA application or not.
By build tools we can automate the java applications.
Build tools generate the source code & also compile the source code(resolve the dependencies in the java applications)
It has 3 types of artifacts (artifacts useful for deployment of application. They compress & zip the entire source code into a package)
==> .war (web archive) --> only for F.E applications (web applications)
==> .jar (java archive)--> only for B.E applications (templates, blogs, advertisements)
==> .ear (enterprise archive--> application subscription

POM file:
==>Project Object Model file, is xml file named as "pom.xml" 
==>By this pom.xml file, we can build the java application because it finds all the configurations of the application (libraries, dependencies etc)

Stages in Maven:
In maven the stages are in uniform order, means the stages are performed in order wise even we exectute code of any stage.
If any errors raised in between, it stops at that particular stage itself.
==>Validate --> checks the syntax
            --> by this we can the snapchat version, which artifact created
            --> we have to move to exact path and execute the code ( # mvn validate)
==>Compile  --> useful to resolve application related dependencies ( # mvn compile)
==>Test     --> useful for testing with Uniform frame work (whenever a developer sends an application for testing, it should meet some conditions & 
                these conditions should also be applicable even after deployment of the application, so it checks while testing....# mvn test)
==>Package  --> Here the application is separated into the 3 artifacts ( # mvn package)
==>clean    --> To clean/delete if an unnecessary data or unwanted content is created ( # mvn clean)
==>Install  --> Whatever artifact we have gets installed in home location ( # mvn install)
==>Deploy   --> Omit
==>All steps are performed steps wise & these steps are pre-determined in maven
