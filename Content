first session(UI):

Content to be added...
Creating Public Repository--> (Individual/collaborators/anyone online can access/view/add/modify in the repository)
Creating Private Repository--> (Only the individual/specified people can access)

==>Creating a file with some content within the default branch(main) in the repository.
==>Commit changes --> helpful for saving the data created. Title and Description should be in organised format, 
   so that it will be helpful for others to view clearly and also who have made the commit changes.
==>Uploading a existing file from local, choose the file, commit changes.
==>We can see what commit changes made by every individual in the repository on specific repository dashboard.
==>both public & private interfaces are same.

second session(UI):
Creating nested branches:
==>Main branch has a single data file.
==>with main branch as the source created a new branch(sub1), automatically auto-merge done with the files in the main branch copied to sub1 branch.
==>now added some contents/files to the sub1 branch.
==>Files in main branch-->1 & files in sub1 branch --> >1
==>Creating new branch(sub2) with "main as source" & another new branch(sub3) with "sub1 as source". 
==>Now the default branch for sub2 is "main" so files in sub2 --> only 1
==>here default branch for sub3 is "sub1" so files in sub3 --> >1
